#  Blood Management System (BMS)

A centralized web-based platform designed for university-level blood donor and recipient management. Developed by MCA Team B (TIET, Patiala), this system streamlines the process of blood donation and requests, ensuring accessibility, reliability, and quick response during medical emergencies.

##  Project Overview

**Problem Statement**  
Finding suitable blood donors during emergencies is often time-consuming and inefficient. The Blood Management System aims to create a platform that connects recipients with potential donors in real-time within the university ecosystem.

**Objective**  
To develop a website where:
- **Donors** can register/update their availability.
- **Recipients** can search and request blood based on blood group.
- **Admins** manage, verify, and monitor users and requests.

##  Features

###  User Authentication
- Unified login/register portal for Admins, Donors, and Recipients.
- Secure login with email/password and role-based access.

###  Donor Module
- Register with blood group, name, and contact.
- View incoming blood requests.
- Accept/Reject requests from recipients (via email interaction).
- Update profile or availability status.

###  Recipient Module
- Search for blood by selecting from dropdown of blood groups.
- View available donors filtered by blood type.
- Send blood request to matching donors (one-by-one mail requests).
- View how many donors the request was sent to.

###  Admin Module
- Add new donors or other admins.
- Edit/Delete existing donor profiles.
- Verify donor authenticity.
- Monitor all requests sent by recipients.

##  Email System

- When a **recipient sends a request**, each matching **donor receives a personalized email**.
- The email includes:
  - Requestor details
  - Option to **Accept** or **Reject**
- Upon donor addition, confirmation mail is sent asking if they wish to join.
