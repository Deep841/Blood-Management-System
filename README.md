#  Blood Management System (BMS)

A centralized web-based platform designed for university-level blood donor and recipient management. Developed by MCA Team B (TIET, Patiala), this system streamlines the process of blood donation and requests, ensuring accessibility, reliability, and quick response during medical emergencies.

##  Project Overview

**Problem Statement**  
Finding suitable blood donors during emergencies is often time-consuming and inefficient. The Blood Management System aims to create a platform that connects recipients with potential donors in real-time within the university ecosystem.

**Objective**  
To develop a website where:
- **Donors** can register/update their availability.
- **Recipients** can search and request blood based on blood group.
- **Admins** manage, verify, and monitor users and requests.

##  Features

###  User Authentication
- Unified login/register portal for Admins, Donors, and Recipients.
- Secure login with email/password and role-based access.

###  Donor Module
- Register with blood group, name, and contact.
- View incoming blood requests.
- Accept/Reject requests from recipients (via email interaction).
- Update profile or availability status.

###  Recipient Module
- Search for blood by selecting from dropdown of blood groups.
- View available donors filtered by blood type.
- Send blood request to matching donors (one-by-one mail requests).
- View how many donors the request was sent to.

###  Admin Module
- Add new donors or other admins.
- Edit/Delete existing donor profiles.
- Verify donor authenticity.
- Monitor all requests sent by recipients.

##  Email System

- When a **recipient sends a request**, each matching **donor receives a personalized email**.
- The email includes:
  - Requestor details
  - Option to **Accept** or **Reject**
- Upon donor addition, confirmation mail is sent asking if they wish to join.

## ðŸ§© System Architecture
The Blood Management System is structured in a modular way to support smooth donor-recipient interaction, secure data handling, and efficient request processing.

1. User Layer
	â€¢	Accessible via browser
	â€¢	Users: Donors, Recipients, Admins
	â€¢	Actions:
	â€¢	Login / Register
	â€¢	Search and Request Blood (Recipient)
	â€¢	Manage Requests (Donor/Admin)

2. Frontend Layer
	â€¢	Built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	â€¢	Role-based UI:
	â€¢	Unified interface post-login
	â€¢	Dynamic content based on role (admin vs donor/recipient)

3. Backend Layer
	â€¢	Framework: Node.js with Express.js
	â€¢	API Routes:
	â€¢	/api/signup, /api/login, /api/verify-otp
	â€¢	/api/students (donor data)
	â€¢	/api/request-blood, /api/my-requests
	â€¢	/api/add-admin, /api/accept-request, /api/reject-request

4. Authentication System
	â€¢	Using JWT (JSON Web Token) for session and access control
	â€¢	Role-based access: only admins can add/edit/delete donors

5. Database Layer
	â€¢	Database: MongoDB
	â€¢	Collections:
	â€¢	Users (Donors, Recipients, Admins)
	â€¢	Students (Donor-specific data)
	â€¢	Requests (Blood requests with status)

6. Email Service
	â€¢	Handled via Nodemailer
	â€¢	Purpose:
	â€¢	Send OTP during signup
	â€¢	Donor confirmation mails
	â€¢	Blood request emails with Accept/Reject options
